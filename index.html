                <h3> Partner Info </h3>
                <p>
                    The Harry Chapin Food Bank of Southwest Florida is the partner organization for this project whose
                    mission is to end hunger in their coverage area.
                    The Food Bank is organized as a hub and spoke model. The main Food Bank headquarters aggregates all
                    of the donations of both money and food. At this headquarters they then distribute the food to what
                    they call “agents” which are the spokes of the model. The agents are actual organizations that
                    distribute the food to people in need which are called “clients”. The agent organizations can range
                    from a few individuals who just want to help to full organizations such as a Salvation Army
                    location.

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    The Food Bank has a number of important data stores that power their operations such as the Donor
                    data,
                    Volunteer information and internal employee information. One of more critical pieces of information
                    is
                    the Agent data stores which contain all of the aggregated reports. While the Food Bank has a lot of
                    great data, what they lack is last-mile data. In this particular case, the client does not have data
                    around the satisfaction of the food being delivered. For example the client wants to explicitly know
                    “Was the food damaged?”, “How was the quality?”, etc. The client further wants to aggregate this
                    data
                    around client types at a generic level (no PII).
                </p>

                <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    The team is proposing a survey solution that can be supplied to either the Agents or Clients to
                    collect the desired last mile data. This solution will likely be deployed as a progressive web
                    application that can be used on either computers or mobile phones. This data will ideally be
                    delivered directly back to the client's internal databases for analysis cross referenced with
                    private Foodbank data.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Feedback Mechanism</h3>
                <p>
                    We are planning to create an MVP version of this solution that we then run by the
                    client (Kevin) for feedback and iteration, in agile style workflow. Ideally we would like to
                    have a single Agent do a trial run
                    of this during the semester for true feedback.
                </p>
                <hr>
                Team's development process is as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Development MVP</li>
                    <li>Test MVP</li>
                    <li>Present MVP to client</li>
                    <li>Gauge feedback (Maybe get a trial run in the real world) </li>
                    <li>Repeat</li>
                </ul>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Name</th>
                        <th>Role</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Douglas Scott Morgan</td>
                        <td>Fullstack Developer/Project Lead</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Prahalad Sanjeev Varma</td>
                        <td>Fullstack Developer</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Prateek Baranwal</td>
                        <td>Fullstack Developer</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Vinayak (Vin) Ajit Nesarikar</td>
                        <td>Fullstack Developer</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <hr>
                <h3>Current System Design Choices</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mobile/desktop accessible Webpage (Written in React.js)</li>
                    <li>Django Python Server Backend</li>
                    <li>Postgres Database</li>
                    <li>Likely Dockerized for easier hand off to the client</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
