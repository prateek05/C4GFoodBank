            <h3> Partner Info </h3>
            <p>
                The Harry Chapin Food Bank of Southwest Florida is the partner organization for this project whose
                mission is to end hunger in their coverage area.
                The Food Bank is organized as a hub and spoke model. The main Food Bank headquarters aggregates all
                of the donations of both money and food. At this headquarters they then distribute the food to what
                they call “agents” which are the spokes of the model. The agents are actual organizations that
                distribute the food to people in need which are called “clients”. The agent organizations can range
                from a few individuals who just want to help to full organizations such as a Salvation Army
                location.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
                The Food Bank has a number of important data stores that power their operations such as the Donor
                data,
                Volunteer information and internal employee information. One of more critical pieces of information
                is
                the Agent data stores which contain all of the aggregated reports. While the Food Bank has a lot of
                great data, what they lack is last-mile data. In this particular case, the client does not have data
                around the satisfaction of the food being delivered. For example the client wants to explicitly know
                “Was the food damaged?”, “How was the quality?”, etc. The client further wants to aggregate this
                data
                around client types at a generic level (no PII).
            </p>

            <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
            <p>
                The team is proposing a survey solution that can be supplied to either the Agents or Clients to
                collect the desired last mile data. This solution will likely be deployed as a progressive web
                application that can be used on either computers or mobile phones. This data will ideally be
                delivered directly back to the client's internal databases for analysis cross referenced with
                private Foodbank data.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Mode of Operation / Feedback Mechanism</h3>
            <p>
                We are planning to create an MVP version of this solution that we then run by the
                client (Kevin) for feedback and iteration, in agile style workflow. We will function as a fully
                agile team. The first kick off with the organization being our understanding of the minimum viable
                product and incorporate amendments till there is a basic agreement. The development life cycle will
                be quick weekly sprints with each sprint readout with our TA Dante and the client partner if
                available. The read-out would demonstrate the current solution and gain feedback, incorporate the
                feedback change in the next feedback cycle. Any feedback occurring during the sprint cycle in
                session would get logged in the backlog before they are picked up in the next weekly sprint.
                Ideally we would like to have a single agency participate in an alpha test run of this during the
                semester for real world assessment.
            </p>

            <h3> Development Life Cycle </h3>
            <p>
                We will be using a GIT based service like Github for our code repository and documentation. Development
                will
                follow the standard branch from develop, commit as often as you can and create a pull request for
                review.
                Each pull request would contain the unit test cases and on merging with development branch would have to
                get
                approved by the peer reviewer of the pull request. End of each sprint would call for develop branch
                merging
                into
                main branch would call for performing the end to end integration test cases. Initially we might start
                with
                performing these tests manually and use GitHub Project Planning to keep a journal on the test conducted
                and
                passed. If time permits we will add a continuous integration agent to our repo to automate the unit test
                cases. Additionally, the test cases will keep expanding till we have sufficient code coverage to build
                trust
                in our software. The deployment would be based on dockerized containers. The code repo will have the
                docker
                config and end of each sprint a weekly container build will be checked into docker central. We aim to be
                compute system agnostic and our client partner shares that vision with us.

                continuous improvement and bring forward our maximum potential as a team and not any specific
